and she's buying a stairway to heaven (And) when she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed With a word she can get what she came for  Ooh ooh ooh…ooh…ooh ooh ooh And she's buying a stairway to heaven  There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings In the tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven  Oooh…It makes me wonder Oooh…It makes me wonder  There's a feeling I get when I look to the west And my spirit is crying for leaving In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees And the voices of those who stand looking  Oooh…It makes me wonder Oooh…And it makes me wonder  And it's whispered that soon, if we all called the tune Then the piper will lead us to reason And a new day will dawn for those who stand long And the forest will echo with laughter  Woe woe woe woe woe oh If there's a bustle in your hedgerow Don't be alarmed now It's just a spring clean for the May Queen Yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run There's still time to change the road you're on  And it makes me wonder…ohhh ooh woe  Your head is humming and it won't go - in case you don´t know The piper's calling you to join him Dear lady can you hear the wind blow and did you know Your stairway lies on the whispering wind  And as we wind on down the road Our shadows taller than our souls There walks a lady we all know Who shines white light and wants to show How everything still turns to gold And if you listen very hard The tune will come to you at last When all are one and one is all, yeah To be a rock and not to roll Ooooooooooooh  And she's buying a stairway to heaven
